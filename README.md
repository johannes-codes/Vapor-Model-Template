# Vapor-Model-Template
A Template to quickly create the Model, DTO, Migration, and Controller in Vapor.

Place the `.xctemplate` folder in your `Base` folder found in the following path: `/Users/<username>/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates/iOS/Base`. 
You may not find a `Templates` folder in your Xcode folder under Library, which is fine. Just create all the necessary folders to complete the path.
